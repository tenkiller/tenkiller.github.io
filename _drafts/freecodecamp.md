title: Free Code Camp
---

I came across this cool website dedicated to teaching people how to code for the web - for free. It's called 
[Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/), and I highly recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in web development. As 
part of the course towards certification, they ask you to complete several basic, intermediate, and advanced projects. This blog post
serves as a record of my experiences with each project. Expect this post to be updated regularly.

## Basic Projects

### Tribute Page

With the first basic project, I must create a tribute page which includes text, an image, and a link to an external site about the 
tribute topic. This blog will be my tribute. The contruction of this page is quite trivial, at least it is for me (no offense to anyone
learning this stuff for the first time).
