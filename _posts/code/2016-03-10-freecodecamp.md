I came across this cool website dedicated to teaching people how to code for the web - for free. It's called 
[Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/), and I highly recommend it to anyone even slightly interested 
in web development. As part of the course towards certification, they ask you to complete several basic, 
intermediate, and advanced projects. This blog post serves as a record of my experiences with each project. 
Expect this post to be updated regularly as my progress continues.

## Basic Projects

### Tribute Page

With the first basic project, I must create a tribute page. My tribute subject is guitarist 
["Dimebag" Darrell Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimebag_Darrell), a music idol of mine during my 
years in high school who tragically lost his life too soon. Along with an action image of him, I figure I 
should include info on the bands he played with and the albums he released.

The technical requirements are simple. It must include an image, text, and a link to an external webpage that 
gives more information on the tribute subject. The page only requires HTML and CSS (most of which is provided 
by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)). The page is static. There is no dynamic interactivity needed.
